                  Villa Central is situated on a quiet one way street in the highly regarded residential area of Manu≈°, which backs on to the Old Town of Split. Consequently, the old streets and Riva are only a 5 minute walk away, which makes it perfect for extended stays of a week or more in Split.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The city of Split is a beautiful town and is a mix of old and new. The Old town features cobblestone streets and is surrounded by ancient walls and monuments. Step a little bit further and you will find the Riva (waterfront), beaches, parks and access to the islands via ferry. 
                </p>*/
